collection of components of governance handbooks relevant for cooperative platforms


this is the start of a collection of components that seem to be useful to consider for  handbooks that describe how coopeative platforms work (in terms of governance & ownership). the ideas are aiming considering the platform coop principles (source https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Amo_JsD6m5IPH7xniaiQ4Y8S2ppjvfkjJrA2K4s5Fus/edit#)

Broad-based ownership, in which stakeholders and workers own, and therefore direct and control, the technological features, production processes, algorithms, data, job structures and all other aspects of their online platform; 

Democratic governance, in which all stakeholders and workers who own the platform collectively self-govern the entity through democratic means and a one-person, one-vote principle; 

Co-design of the platform, in which various users and marginalized persons are included in the design and creation of the platform ensuring that software is not pushed down onto users, but instead grows out of their needs, capacities, and aspirations; and

A commitment to open source development, so that platform co-ops can build new structures of collective ownership and democratic governance internally, while lifting up other emerging cooperatives in disparate locations, who instead of having to reinvent the wheel alone, can apply the cooperative model locally through a commons of open source code.
